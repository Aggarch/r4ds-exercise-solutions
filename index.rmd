# Welcome {-}

This contains my exercise solutions for Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund, [R for Data Science](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1). The original website is at [r4ds.had.co.nz](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

Note that the chapter and section numbers don't exactly match those of R4DS.
Refer to the titles, not the numbers.
