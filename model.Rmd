# (PART) Model {-}

# Introduction {#model-intro}

Some of the discussion of models is slightly different, and has a different emphasis than in most social science research.
This is largely because this book is speaking to data scientists, where the primary goal is prediction rather than theory testing (that I don't view these as too different is a different story).

The discussion about hypothesis generation vs. confirmation is interesting.
Too little emphasis is placed on hypothesis generation in social science.
The importance of out of sample testing also receives too little emphasis in political science.

And from this discussion it should be clear that many papers in social science are hypothesis generation masquerading as hypothesis confirmation.
