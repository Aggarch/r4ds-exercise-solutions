## Getting started

**Notes**

- `read_log()` is important for web data, but likely ot be  irrelevant to most political science research

    
**TODO** fill in the links and add any missing

## Parsing a vector

**Notes:** This is detailed, but these details can make your life hell. Skim now, but be aware that what should be simple, actually is not.

This Computerphile video on Unicode is great [Characters, Symbols and the Unicode Miracle - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)

Note that these issues are real. Reusing one of Chris Adolph's csv files from an earlier version of this course gave me problems, resulting in me filing this [bug report](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues/111).

The suggested reading is very useful: http://kunststube.net/encoding/

This becomes especially useful when you take "Text as Data".

## Other Types of Data

**NOTES** Expand on what's in this section:

- The `rio` package is very useful for loading different types of 
- Other useful functions and packages not mentioned here:

  - Stata: haven, read_dta. While the **foreign** package in R reads Stata files, it cannot read files created by the most recent version of Stata (> 13).
  - SPSS: `haven::read_spss`
  - SAS: `haven::read_sas`
  - XLS: `readxl::read_excel`
  - JSON: **jsonlite** pacakge. However, often there are APIs and clients which make this easier, e.g. **pollstR** which returns data from the Huffington Post Pollster API.
  - XML: xml2
  - HTML: rvest
  - Databases: **DBI** and backends
  - PDF: This is really a different thing as you are extracting data from an unstructured form. It also depends on whether the PDF text is actually an image as from a scan, in which case you need to use OCR to first indentify words.
  
    - `tabulizer`: extracts tables from PDF documents
    - `pdftools`: extracts text from pdf documents
    - Also see general text analysis packages like `tm`, `quanteda`, etc. which often have functions to assist with getting text from PDFs.
