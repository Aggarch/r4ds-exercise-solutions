# Introduction

## Acknowledgments {-}

All the credit should go to Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham for writing the truly fantastic *R for Data Science* book,
without which these solutions would not exist---literally.

This book was written in the open, with some people contributed pull requests to fix problems.
Thank you to all who contributed via [GitHub](https://github.com/jrnold/r4ds-exercise-solutions/graphs/contributors).
